# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

**Example:**

```javascript
const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
```

`secondLetterOfFirstName` would have a value of the string `d`.

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

## Tests

The `thirdLetterOfLastName` variable should have the value of `v`.

You should use bracket notation.
