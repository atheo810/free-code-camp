# Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

The `/=` operator divides a variable by another number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar / 5;
```

Will divide `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar /= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

## Tests

`a` should equal `4`.

`b` should equal `27`.

`c` should equal `3`.

You should use the `/=` operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
