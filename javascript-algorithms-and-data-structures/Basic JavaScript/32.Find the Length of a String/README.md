# Find the Length of a String

You can find the length of a `String` value by writing `.length` after the string variable or string literal.

**Example:**


```javascript
console.log("Alan Peter".length);
```

The value `10` would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable `const firstName = "Ada"`, we could find out how long the string `Ada` is by using the `firstName.length` property.

Use the `.length` property to set `lastNameLength` to the number of characters in `lastName`.

## Tests

You should not change the variable declarations in the `// Setup` section.

`lastNameLength` should be equal to eight.

You should be getting the length of `lastName` by using `.length` like this: `lastName.length.`
