# Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:


```javascript
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
```

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

## Tests

`myArray` should be an array.

The first item in `myArray` should be a string.

The second item in `myArray` should be a number.
