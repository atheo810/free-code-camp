# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:


```javascript
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: `functionName()`; Each time the function is called it will print out the message `Hello World` on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

1.Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.

2.Call the function.


## Tests

`reusableFunction` should be a function.

If `reusableFunction` is called, it should output the string `Hi World` to the console.

You should call `reusableFunction` once it is defined.
