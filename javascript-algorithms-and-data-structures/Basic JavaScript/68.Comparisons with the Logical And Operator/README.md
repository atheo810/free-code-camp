# Comparisons with the Logical And Operator

Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (`&&`) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are `true`.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an `if` statement inside another `if`.

**Examples**

```javascript
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
```

This code will return `Yes` if `num` is greater than `5` and less than `10`. The same logic can be written with the logical and operator.

```javascript
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
```

Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the `&&` operator, which will return the string `Yes` if `val` is less than or equal to `50` and greater than or equal to `25`. Otherwise, will return the string `No`.

## Tests

You should use the `&&` operator once

You should only have one `if` statement

`testLogicalAnd(0)` should return the string `No`

`testLogicalAnd(24)` should return the string `No`

`testLogicalAnd(25)` should return the string `Yes`

`testLogicalAnd(30)` should return the string `Yes`

`testLogicalAnd(50)` should return the string `Yes`

`testLogicalAnd(51)` should return the string `No`

`testLogicalAnd(75)` should return the string `No`

`testLogicalAnd(80)` should return the string `No`
