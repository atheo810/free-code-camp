# Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript

Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a `Math.random()` function that generates a random decimal number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive). Thus `Math.random()` can return a `0` but never return a `1`.

**Note:** Like Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the `return` executes, so we can `return` the value of the `Math.random()` function.

Change `randomFraction` to return a random number instead of returning `0`.

## Tests

`randomFraction` should return a random number.

The number returned by `randomFraction` should be a decimal.

You should be using `Math.random` to generate the random decimal number.
