# Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

```javascript
myVar = myVar + 5;
```

to add `5` to `myVar`. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the `+=` operator.

```javascript
let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
```

`6` would be displayed in the console.

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `+=` operator.

## Tests

`a` should equal `15`.

`b` should equal `26`.

`c` should equal `19`.

You should use the `+=` operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
