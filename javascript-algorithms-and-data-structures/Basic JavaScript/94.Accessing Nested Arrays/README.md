# Accessing Nested Arrays

As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

```javascript
const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: ["Meowzer", "Fluffy", "Kit-Cat"],
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: ["Spot", "Bowser", "Frankie"],
  },
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];
```

`ourPets[0].names[1]` would be the string `Fluffy`, and `ourPets[1].names[0]` would be the string `Spot`.

Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable `secondTree` to the second item in the `trees` list from the `myPlants` object.

## Tests

`secondTree` should equal the string `pine`.

Your code should use dot and bracket notation to access `myPlants`.
