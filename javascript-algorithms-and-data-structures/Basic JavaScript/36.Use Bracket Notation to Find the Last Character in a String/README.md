# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `const firstName = "Ada"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
```

`lastLetter` would have a value of the string `a`.

Use bracket notation to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

## Tests

`lastLetterOfLastName` should be the letter `e`.

You should use `.length` to get the last letter.
