# Logical Order in If Else Statements

Order is important in `if`, `else if` statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:

**Examples**

```javascript
function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```

And the second just switches the order of the statements:

```javascript
function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```

While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

```javascript
foo(0);
bar(0);
```

`foo(0)` will return the string Less than one, and `bar(0)` will return the string `Less than two.`

Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.

## Tests

`orderMyLogic(4)` should return the string `Less than 5`

`orderMyLogic(6)` should return the string `Less than 10`

`orderMyLogic(11)` should return the string `Greater than or equal to 10`
