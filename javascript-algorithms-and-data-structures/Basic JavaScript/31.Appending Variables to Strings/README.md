# Appending Variables to Strings

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (`+=`) operator.

**Example:**


```javascript
const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
```

`ourStr` would have the value `freeCodeCamp is awesome!.`

Set `someAdjective` to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to `myStr` using the `+=` operator.

## Tests

`someAdjective` should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.

You should append `someAdjective` to `myStr` using the `+=` operator.
