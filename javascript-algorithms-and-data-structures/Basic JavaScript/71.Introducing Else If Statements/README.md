# Introducing Else If Statements

If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain `if` statements together with `else if` statements.

**Examples**

```javascript
if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}
```

Convert the logic to use `else if` statements.

## Tests

You should have at least two `else` statements

You should have at least two `if` statements

You should have closing and opening curly braces for each `if else` code block.

`testElseIf(0)` should return the string `Smaller than 5`

`testElseIf(5)` should return the string `Between 5 and 10`

`testElseIf(7)` should return the string `Between 5 and 10`

`testElseIf(10)` should return the string `Between 5 and 10`

`testElseIf(12)` should return the string `Greater than 10`
