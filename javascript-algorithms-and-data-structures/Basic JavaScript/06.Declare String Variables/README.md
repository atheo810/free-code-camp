# Declare String Variables

Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

```javascript
var myName;
```

But you can also declare a string variable like this:

```javascript
var myName = "your name";
```

`"your name"` is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
