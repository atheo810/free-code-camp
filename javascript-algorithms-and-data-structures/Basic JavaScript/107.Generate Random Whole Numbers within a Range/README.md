# Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range

Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number `min` and a maximum number `max`.

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
```

Create a function called `randomRange` that takes a range `myMin` and `myMax` and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to `myMin`, and is less than or equal to `myMax`, inclusive.

## Tests

The lowest random number that can be generated by `randomRange` should be equal to your minimum number, `myMin`.

The highest random number that can be generated by `randomRange` should be equal to your maximum number, `myMax`.

The random number generated by `randomRange` should be an integer, not a decimal.

`randomRange` should use both `myMax` and `myMin`, and return a random number in your range.
