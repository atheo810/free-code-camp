# Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators

In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to check multiple conditions:

```javascript
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  } else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  } else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
```

The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

```javascript
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b
    ? "a and b are equal"
    : a > b
    ? "a is greater"
    : "b is greater";
}
```

In the `checkSign` function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in `findGreaterOrEqual` - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return `positive`, `negative` or `zero`.

## Tests.

`checkSign` should use multiple conditional operators

`checkSign(10)` should return the string `positive`. Note that capitalization matters

`checkSign(-12)` should return the string `negative`. Note that capitalization matters

`checkSign(0)` should return the string `zero`. Note that capitalization matters
