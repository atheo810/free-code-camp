# Introducing Else Statements

When a condition for an `if` statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an `else` statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

**Examples**

```javascript
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}
```

Combine the `if` statements into a single `if/else` statement.

## Tests

You should only have one `if` statement in the editor

You should use an `else` statement

`testElse(4)` should return the string `5 or Smaller`

`testElse(5)` should return the string `5 or Smaller`

`testElse(6)` should return the string `Bigger than 5`

`testElse(10)` should return the string `Bigger than 5`

You should not change the code above or below the specified comments.
