# Modify Array Data With Indexes

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with `const`.

**Example**

```javascript
const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
```

`ourArray` now has the value `[15, 40, 30]`.

**Note:** There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like `array [0]`. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Modify the data stored at index `0` of `myArray` to a value of `45`.

## Tests

`myArray` should now be `[45, 64, 99]`.
You should be using correct index to modify the value in `myArray`.
