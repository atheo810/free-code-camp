# Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript

It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

1 . Use `Math.random()` to generate a random decimal.

2 . Multiply that random decimal by `20`.

3 . Use another function, `Math.floor()` to round the number down to its nearest whole number.

Remember that `Math.random()` can never quite return a `1` and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get `20`. This technique will give us a whole number between `0` and `19`.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
```

We are calling `Math.random()`, multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to `Math.floor()` function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between `0` and `9`.

## Tests

The result of `randomWholeNum` should be a whole number.

You should use `Math.random` to generate a random number.

You should have multiplied the result of `Math.random` by 10 to make it a number that is between zero and nine.

You should use `Math.floor` to remove the decimal part of the number.
