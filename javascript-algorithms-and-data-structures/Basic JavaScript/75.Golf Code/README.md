# Golf Code

In the game of Golf, each hole has a `par`, meaning, the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed `par` and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the `strokes` in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

**Examples**

```javascript
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"
par + 2	"Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"
```

`par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.

## Tests

`golfScore(4, 1)` should return the string `Hole-in-one!`

`golfScore(4, 2)` should return the string `Eagle`

`golfScore(5, 2)` should return the string `Eagle`

`golfScore(4, 3)` should return the string `Birdie`

`golfScore(4, 4)` should return the string `Par`

`golfScore(1, 1)` should return the string `Hole-in-one!`

`golfScore(5, 5)` should return the string `Par`

`golfScore(4, 5)` should return the string `Bogey`

`golfScore(4, 6)` should return the string `Double Bogey`

`golfScore(4, 7)` should return the string `Go Home!`

`golfScore(5, 9)` should return the string `Go Home!`
