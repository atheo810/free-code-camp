# Access Array Data with Indexes

We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of `0`.

**Example**

```javascript
const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];
```

The `console.log(array[0])` prints `50`, and `data` has the value `60`.

Create a variable called `myData` and set it to equal the first value of `myArray` using bracket notation.

## Tests

The variable `myData` should equal the first value of `myArray`.

Waiting:The data in variable `myArray` should be accessed using bracket notation.
