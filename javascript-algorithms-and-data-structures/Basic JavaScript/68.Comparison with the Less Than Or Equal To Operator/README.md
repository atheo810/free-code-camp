# Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator

The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

**Examples**

```javascript
4   <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5   <= 5 // true
3   <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

```

Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

## Tests

`testLessOrEqual(0)` should return the string `Smaller Than or Equal to 12`

`testLessOrEqual(11)` should return the string `Smaller Than or Equal to 12`

`testLessOrEqual(12)` should return the string `Smaller Than or Equal to 12`

`testLessOrEqual(23)` should return the string `Smaller Than or Equal to 24`

`testLessOrEqual(24)` should return the string `Smaller Than or Equal to 24`

`testLessOrEqual(25)` should return the string `More Than 24`

`testLessOrEqual(55)` should return the string `More Than 24`

You should use the `<=` operator at least twice
