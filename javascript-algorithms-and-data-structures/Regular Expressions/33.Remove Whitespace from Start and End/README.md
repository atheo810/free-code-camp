# Remove Whitespace from Start and End

Sometimes whitespace characters around strings are not wanted but are there. Typical processing of strings is to remove the whitespace at the start and end of it.

Write a regex and use the appropriate string methods to remove whitespace at the beginning and end of strings.

**Note:** The `String.prototype.trim()` method would work here, but you'll need to complete this challenge using regular expressions.

## Tests

result should be equal to the string `Hello, World!`

Your solution should not use the `String.prototype.trim()` method.

The `result` variable should not directly be set to a string

The value of the `hello` variable should not be changed.
