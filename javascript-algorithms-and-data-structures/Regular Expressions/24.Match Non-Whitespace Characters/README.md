# Match Non-Whitespace Characters

You learned about searching for whitespace using `\s`, with a lowercase `s`. You can also search for everything except whitespace.

Search for non-whitespace using `\S`, which is an uppercase `s`. This pattern will not match whitespace, carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it being similar to the character class `[^ \r\t\f\n\v]`.

```javascript
let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!";
let nonSpaceRegex = /\S/g;
whiteSpace.match(nonSpaceRegex).length;
```

The value returned by the `.length` method would be `32`.

Change the regex `countNonWhiteSpace` to look for multiple non-whitespace characters in a string.

## Tests

Your regex should use the global flag.

Your regex should use the shorthand character `\S` to match all non-whitespace characters.

Your regex should find 35 non-spaces in the string `Men are from Mars and women are from Venus.`

Your regex should find 23 non-spaces in the string `Space: the final frontier.`

Your regex should find 21 non-spaces in the string `MindYourPersonalSpace`
