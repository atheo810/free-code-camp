# Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow

The `btn-primary` class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

Replace Bootstrap's `btn-default` class with `btn-primary` in your button.

Note that this button will still need the btn and `btn-block` classes.

## Tests

Your `button` should have the class `btn-primary`.

Your `button` should still have the btn and `btn-block` classes.

All your `button` elements should have closing tags.
