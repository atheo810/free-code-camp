# Center Text with Bootstrap

Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class `text-center` to our `h2` element.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this:

```html
<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>
```

## Tests

Your `h2` element should be centered by applying the class `text-center`

Your `h2` element should still have the class `red-text`
