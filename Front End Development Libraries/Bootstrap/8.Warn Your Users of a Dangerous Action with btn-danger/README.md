# Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger

Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The `btn-danger` class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.

Create a button with the text `Delete` and give it the class `btn-danger`.

Note that these buttons still need the `btn` and `btn-block` classes.

## Tests

You should create a new `button` element with the text Delete.

All of your Bootstrap buttons should have the `btn` and `btn-block` classes.

Your new button should have the class `btn-danger`.

All of your `button` elements should have closing tags.
