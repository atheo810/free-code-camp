# Create a Bootstrap Button

Bootstrap has its own styles for `button` elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

Create a new `button` element below your large kitten photo. Give it the `btn` and `btn-default` classes, as well as the text of `Like`.

## Tests

You should create a new `button` element with the text `Like`.

Your new button should have two classes: `btn` and `btn-default`.

All of your `button` elements should have closing tags.
