# Make Images Mobile Responsive

First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its `src` attribute to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg`.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the `img-responsive` class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.

## Tests

You should have a total of two images.

Your new image should be below your old one and have the class `img-responsive`.

Your new image should not have the class `smaller-image`.

Your new image should have a `src` of `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg`.

Your new `img` element should have a closing angle bracket.
